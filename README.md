# Magic Mirror

The front end for this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

The back end was generated by the [Spring Boot Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

There is a scheduler class which will contact the national rail API for train times and the open weather API for weather and push this to a websocket endpoint which is picked up by the front end to display.
